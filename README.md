SSR (for use ssr : npm run build:ssr, npm run serve:ssr:newAngular) 

** SSR (Server-Side Rendering) in Angular allows your Angular application to render pages on the server instead of the client. This can improve performance, especially for users on slow networks, and enhance SEO (Search Engine Optimization) because search engines can index the content more easily. With SSR, the server sends a fully rendered page to the client, and then Angular takes over for any subsequent interactions.
